    "content": "Summer is over and it is autumn again, beautiful as ever. Even if you are no artist at all you can see its beauty. It is a season when the trees are simply fantastic â€” yellow, red, green and brown, not just one brown, but browns of all possible shades: light brown, dark brown, yellowish brown and all of a richness that only an artist can see and describe.Victor is back in Vorontsovo. He has just come but his thoughts are still in Kiev where the autumn is so beautiful. This is not his first visit there. He has already been to Kiev and he has learnt its streets, roads, parks, theatres, cinemas and old and new beautiful buildings. He easily recognizes the streets, buildings, buses, parks and the noise. Noise is everywhere. Now he is with his classmates and the usual talk begins.",

    "content": "The big clock on the tower of the Palace of Westminster in London is often called Big Ben. But Big Ben is really the bell of the clock. It is the biggest clock bell in Britain. It weighs 13.5 tons.The clock tower is 318 feet high. You have to go up 374 steps to reach the top. So the clock looks small from the pavement below the tower.But its face is 23 feet wide. It would only just fit into some classrooms.The minute-hand is 14 feet long. Its weight is equal to that of two bags of coal. The hour-hand is 9 feet long.The clock bell is called Big Ben after Sir Benjamin Hall. He had the job to see that the bell was put up.Sir Benjamin was a big man. One day he said in Parliament, 'Shall we call the bell St. Stephen's?' St. Stephen's is the name of the tower.But someone said for a joke, 'Why not call it Big Ben?' Now the bell is known all over the world by that name.",

At half past seven he got up, washed, did his morning exercises at an open window, dressed and had breakfast. Vadim Petrovich likes mornings, because he can see his family, and he can have a talk with his wife and children. At a quarter to nine Vadim Petrovich left home. It was a cold winter day. There was a lot of snow on the ground. The sky wasn't blue, and the sun didn't shine at all. There weren't any people in the street. Vadim Petrovich went to the farm. It is not far from his house, so he walks there. The road was white with snow and he couldn't walk fast. When he came to the farm, some people wanted to see and talk to him. His working day began. At 1 o'clock he went home to have dinner. He had dinner with his wife and little daughter who does not go to school. He ate his dinner, rested a little, and went back to the farm. Vadim Petrovich had to talk to some people, to write some letters, and to do some other work. At 5 o'clock he had an important meeting. And only at 8 o'clock he came home.",
